Create a python program and push it to the repository.
nb : each individual must commit and push to the repository.
clue : add as a contributor.
Group Big Data 1 : 1. Muhammad Adam, 2. Bayu Lesmana, 3. Malvin Nugraha.
Here we create a python program operating matrix 3*3.

note : I use account faishalyb to test the difference between adding files to main and adding files to branch
the difference is if you just add files in branch so the contributor and the language doesn't appear on the home page
I add file kalimatrix.py for test, and then the languange appear on the home page
I add file .txt use account faishalyb and I delete it use my account
after I made sure I gave orders to my group mates to try to add files in main

How I push my file to repository ?
I use command line add remote origin <my repo url> and then I push it
How my team mate push file to my repository ?
He tried the same as me but he got an error like this "error : failed to push some refs to <my repo url>", and my group have no idea for this
Anyone who has a solution can directly type below
After that he used an alternative solution by adding the file directly via git hub.

Thanks from group big data 1.
