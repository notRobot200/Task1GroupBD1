Here we create a python program operating matrix 3*3.

note : I use account faishalyb to test the difference between adding files to main and adding files to branch
the difference is if you just add files in branch so the contributor and the language doesn't appear on the home page
I add file kalimatrix.py for test, and then the languange appear on the home page
I add file .txt use account faishalyb and I delete it use my account
after I made sure I gave orders to my group mates to try to add files in main

How I push my file to repository ?
I use command line add remote origin <my repo url> and then I push it
How my team mate push file to my repository ?
He tried the same as me but he got an error like this "error : failed to push some refs to <my repo url>"
It is because the remote to master so he only push to master

After that he used an alternative solution by adding the file directly via git hub.
